We should get clear about what's the real training of your learning object.

Take learning English as an example.

Listening and reading are the real practices when it comes to learning English.

You may ask what about talking and writing?

That's the practice when it comes to the second phase. And we're already aware of the importance of Output.

But lots of us make mistakes in the phase of Input.

Not working hard on memorizing vocabulary or studying grammar.

It doesn't mean that those jobs are not important.

**It's all about the right learning path and efficiency.**

We should familiarize ourself with vocabulary and grammar by searching if we get stuck when reading or listening.

**Do the tasks that yields 80% of the results with only 20% of the effort.**

Let's get a little deeper.

**The practices can help us develop faster pattern recognition _in the "real world"_ are the real practices.**

Memorizing vocabulary or studying grammar may help us improving pattern recognition but they are not in the "real world".
